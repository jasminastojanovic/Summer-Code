### Application - Baby Dairy
_Project idea_: The idea of the project is to make online application 
which brings parents to save the best moments in their baby's growth.
We usually use the printed version of "Baby dairy" which doesn't support video records. 
Also, the images must be printed in the photo stores which takes too much time.
And final result is unfilled printed baby diary.

This application should be very intuitive, providing you fast and easy way to upload videos and images,
with solutions to adding text about important things (for example: baby's coming home, wight, height...)
